    "## What is GoT?     \n",
    "**Game of Thrones** (GoT) is an American fantasy drama television series created by David Benioff and D. B. Weiss. It is an adaptation of A Song of Ice and Fire, George R. R. Martin's series of fantasy novels, the first of which is A Game of Thrones. It is filmed in Belfast and elsewhere in the United Kingdom, Canada, Croatia, Iceland, Malta, Morocco, Spain, and the United States. The series premiered on HBO in the United States on April 17, 2011, and its seventh season ended on August 27, 2017. The series will conclude with its eighth season premiering in 2019. ([site from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones))  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal of the tutorial\n",
    "Along with its exciting story, the numerous death of characters is also a characteristic of GoT series. This tutorial will predict which characters will die in the next season of GoT with some NLP techniques learnt from the course. \n",
    "\n",
    "## How to make the prediction?\n",
    "The prediction of this tutorial is based on the assumption that people with **similar personality** will have great possibility to end up in a same way. Thus we will fetch the personality text from the [**Fandom Wiki**](http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Game_of_Thrones_Wiki) page. Then we will do word embedding to each text transform them to vectors in a high dimensional space. For each living charactor we will compare his vector, representing his personality, with the vectors from those dead character. Being more similiar to the dead characters leads to a higher possibility to be dead in the next season. In the later part of the tutorial, I will introduce how to achieve that goal in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Library Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of later work in the tutorial is based on NLP, thus we need liararies to fetch text from html as well as do word embedding.\n",
    "1. [**Beatuiful Soup**](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/): A library used for fetching data from html.\n",
    "2. [**nltk**](https://www.nltk.org/): A library used for natural language processing. In this tutorial, we will use it to do text tokenization and remove stop words from the text.\n",
    "3. [**Gensim**](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/): A library that realize unsupervised semantic modelling from plain text. In this tutorial, we will use it to do the word embedding to the plain text.\n",
    "4. [**Scipy**](https://www.scipy.org/): A library used for scientific calculation in Python.\n",
    "Since we have already used Beautiful Soup, Scipy and nltk in the assignments, the installation will just be omitted. For Gensim library you can just install it with pip.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install --upgrade gensim\n",

      "\"You are a Stark. You may not have my name, but you have my blood.\"\n",
      "―Eddard Stark to Jon before he leaves for the Night's Watch.[src]Because he was raised by Ned Stark at Winterfell, Jon has adopted a clear moral compass and a true sense of honor, which he tries his hardest to abide by even when he must make a difficult decision, especially after he became Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. He has always admired and idolized his father, but due to Catelyn Stark's cold disdain for Jon, Eddard was careful not to give him more attention than his lawful children by Catelyn. Lady Stark was never actively mean to Jon, but because he wasn't her own son she intentionally ignored him (as is common for bastard children), meaning that Jon grew up without a mother-figure. Nor did Jon consider Catelyn's behavior to be unusual or unexpected: it is rare for a noble to raise their bastard child alongside their lawful children, and his presence was a great insult to her honor. While his interactions with Catelyn remained awkward or nonexistent, he actually became good friends with his half-siblings, particularly Robb and Arya. Robb was of the same age as Jon so they became playmates and comrades in training, while due to her tomboyish personality Arya was also something of a social misfit like Jon, which they bonded over.\n",
      "Like many bastard children, Jon had to learn to grow up quickly. This made Jon mature and perceptive beyond his age, so he could navigate his complicated relationships within the Stark household. His bastard status has also made Jon something of a loner, solemn and somber with a desire to prove himself to society and to his father. Jon thought that the best way for a bastard in his position to gain honor and respect was to join the Night's Watch, emulating his uncle Benjen, because past social status is ignored after joining the Watch. Despite his introverted demeanor, Jon is very compassionate and protective of his fellow outcasts such as Samwell Tarly, Grenn, and Pyp.\n",
      "In many ways, Jon has been unusually lucky for a bastard child, given how rare it is for a lord to raise one in his own castle alongside his lawful children. For all of Jon's misgivings about not knowing his mother and Catelyn ignoring and shunning him, he was loved by his father and siblings, was never poor or hungry, but lived in a castle and had a noble's upbringing. Jon was formally educated by Maester Luwin and was trained in combat by Ser Rodrik Cassel, excelling at swordsmanship. This made Jon somewhat arrogant when he was a new recruit at Castle Black, until Tyrion pointed out that the other recruits were all far less fortunate than he was. This humbles Jon, and he changes his behavior to be the champion of the other downtrodden recruits, and helps train them by walking them through the swordplay techniques he knows.\n",
      "The Starks were an interfaith household, with Eddard and Catelyn's children being exposed to not only the religion of the Old Gods of the Forest worshiped by most Northmen, but also Catelyn's devout adherence to the Faith of the Seven. Because Jon had no real interaction with Catelyn, and revered his father Eddard, he was not exposed to the Seven but proudly keeps to the Old Gods, and honors the traditions of his First Men ancestors. When Jon took his vow to become a member of the Night's Watch, he chose to do so in front of a heart tree, sacred to the Old Gods.\n",
      "Jon is also fairly shy around women, and as he revealed to Samwell, he was a virgin when he joined the Night's Watch. While he was attractive enough, as a bastard son with nothing to inherit he had no realistic marriage prospects with noblewomen. Jon was even wary of having sex with random girls or prostitutes (as Theon did), because he was terrified of fathering a bastard of his own: having lived his life as a bastard, he felt that it wasn't a life another child should have to go through.\n",
      "However, death has changed Jon. Despite his honorable convictions and previous commitment to the Night's Watch, his experience of being murdered by his own men and then revived has made Jon far more cynical and nihilistic. No longer believing in himself and his ability to face the coming threat, due to being murdered for doing what he thought was right - Jon abandons the Night's Watch, despite knowing full well how dangerous the threat looming beyond the Wall really is. He loses his determination about fighting and becomes much more lonely and melancholic only speaking when he hasn't any other choice. Also, Jon feels remorse for hanging his former steward Olly, even though the latter did murder both him and the woman he loved. While he is wary of conflict since his return, his love for his family has brought him back into the fight. To this end, Jon chooses his family over the Night's Watch - a choice he once attempted to make when Robb marched off to war, but forsook in the past. When Ramsay decides to play a \"game\" with Rickon, Jon once again chooses his family by attempting to save his little brother's life, even at the cost of his own life and battle plans.\n",

Thus, we will just use the [**pre-train model**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM/edit) provided by google. (If you want to run the code, you need to **download it by yourself**. Putting it in the **same directory** as this notebook and name it as \"**GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin**\") It is a 1.5 Gb binary file loading it require a 64-bit machine and at least 4Gb memory. Here is a small sample showing how to load and use it with gensim. "
